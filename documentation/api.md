## Foreword

_Unlike the MyBaxi app by BAXI (aka BDR Thermea Group), which already has a custom integration available for Home Assistant (see: [remeha_home](https://github.com/msvisser/remeha_home) â€” known through to [alessandromatera/baxi-node-red](https://github.com/alessandromatera/baxi-node-red)), Baxi's HybridApp relies on the Servitly platform to provide its services._
